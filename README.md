## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### Effective Copilot Prompting
- **Be Specific**: Instead of "fix this", say "fix the null pointer error in the cart calculation"
- **Provide Context**: Include relevant code and requirements in your prompts
- **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on initial suggestions
- **Use Comments**: Write comments describing what you need before generating code

### Working with Copilot Chat
- Ask for explanations: "Explain what this function does"
- Request alternatives: "Suggest a better way to implement this"
- Debug strategically: "Why is this test failing?"
- Generate tests: "Create unit tests for this function with edge cases"

### Best Practices
1. **Review AI Suggestions**: Always review and understand generated code
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate all AI-generated code with tests
3. **Maintain Standards**: Ensure AI code follows your team's conventions
4. **Learn Patterns**: Study generated code to improve your skills
5. **Stay Secure**: Be cautious with sensitive data in prompts
